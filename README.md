# Hyperspace

A multi-page theme with scroll-animated home sections for Stackbit. [Live Demo](https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/hyperspace)

### About Stackbit

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) enables features like inline content editing, live previews and collaboration tools for Jamstack sites.

## Working with This Theme

This theme is written in [Unibit](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/), which is designed to transpile themes to work with multiple static site generators (SSG) such as Jekyll, Hugo & Gatsby. To compile an SSG-specific version of the theme, you'll need to use the Unibit CLI.

### Develop Locally Using Unibit

Here's how to get started with local development using the Unibit CLI. 

```
npm install -g @stackbit/unibit
```

Start the local development server. 

```

```

### Develop Using CodeSandbox
